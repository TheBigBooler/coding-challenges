Given an integer array, divide the array into 2 subsets A and B while repsecting the following conditions:

The intersection of A and B is null
The union of A and B is equal to the original array
The number of elemenents in subset A is minimal
The sum of A's elements is greater than the sum of B's elements

Return the subset A in increasing order where the sum of A's elements is greater than the sum of B's elements.
If more than one subset exists, return the one with the  maximal sum.
